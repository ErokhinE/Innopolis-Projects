Task1:

Given an oriented graph, determination if it has a cycle of negative weight and print it (if exists).

Task2:

Given a graph of a computer network where each edge has a length in meters and bandwidth.
Program using AdjacencyMatrixGraph to compute the shortest path from host (A) to host (B) with a requirement of minimum bandwidth (W).
