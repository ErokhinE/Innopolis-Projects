Task 1:

Switch - branching
Become familiar with switch-branching (Just Google it)
Using this branching, write a calculator such that user inputs number_1, number_2 (-1e8 <= number_1,number_2 <= 1e8) and operator separated by comma. For example:
2, 5, + The code should return 7
Prevent division by zero!

Task2:

This problem is part 2 of the first problem
Write same calculator without branching but with functions. Make possible to add, subtract letters such that (no divisions )
Test cases:
input >--> output
a,b,+ >--> ab
abb,b,- >--> ab
aba,b,- >--> error message
Make possible to multiply words on integers such that
abc,2,* >--> abcabc

Task3:

First largest single integer using pointers
First largest single integer using pointers (30)
You have a String S containing N<100 elements with no spaces (letters, numbers, etc). Write a C++ program to find the first largest single integer (one digit
number [-9,9] ) that occurs in this string and then print it, and its index in the string using pointers/functions that have parameters as pointers or references.
here you can see examples:
notice in the first example you have 2 fives, you take the first one
and its index starts from: 0 for ‘w’.
display the message ‘-1’ if you don’t find numbers in the string.
for the negative integers print the index of the integer itself like in the second example(without the minus).
