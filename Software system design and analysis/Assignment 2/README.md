Task 1:Matrix Algebra:

In C++ programming language write an OOP program that allows to:
‚óè store matrices n by m (create a necessary class);
‚óè input / output from input.txt and output.txt;
‚óè assign one matrix to another (overload = operator);
‚óè add two matrices A and B (overload the + operator, prints the error message);
‚óè subtract two matrices A and B (overload the - operator, prints the error message
if needed);
‚óè multiply two matrices A and B (overload the * operator, prints the error
message if needed);
‚óè transpose matrix.
Input format (look at the examles)
The input contains, in the same order:
‚óè The sizes of an A matrix in 2 different rows. Then in a new line the values of
the elements A.
‚óè The sizes of a B matrix in 2 different rows. Then in a new line the values of the
elements B.
‚óè The sizes of a C matrix in 2 different rows. Then in a new line the values of the
elements C.
We are working under the assumption of the correctness of the input data.

Task 2: The Emperor and Happiness:

You are the emperor of a medieval empire, and tomorrow is your crowning ceremony.
The event is the most significant gathering you have ever thrown.
You want people to be happy, so you ordered N magical happiness potion
flagons (containers). However, one of the N magical happiness potion flagons you
had planned to open for the ceremony has been found to be poisonous.
Before death, the toxin shows no signs. Even the smallest amount of that poison
consumed causes death within 20 - 40 hours .
You have just under 48 hours to identify the poisoned flagon . Your celebration
would be ruined if any more people were slaughtered; you have some capitally
punished inmates (going to be executed), that you can make drink from these
flagons.
Write a function to calculate the bare minimum count of Capitally punished
inmates you need to risk their lives for the purpose of accurately and definitely
determining the poisonous flagon within the 48 hours limit. (20) marks
Explain your algorithm with 1-2 comments in the code. (10) marks
